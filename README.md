# music-tracker

## Description:
Our Spotify tracker web app allows music listeners to view their music tastes and stats, analyze their listening history and trends, and compare with their friends. It is similar to Spotify Wrapped but supports more timeframes and will track more metrics. We will be storing user’s listening history and with this data, users can view their own historical stats and compare them with their friend’s stats. If we have extra time, we would like to explore suggesting new content to users based on their listening history and their friend’s listening history. Perhaps auto-generating playlists.

## Some additional functionality: 
- [ ] Community sharing
- [ ] Genre specific music “share rooms”
- [ ] Extensions to shows, podcasts, etc.
- [ ] Allow artists to interact with listeners of their music
- [ ] Use machine learning to recommend users new music (very stretch!)

## Minimal Requirements:
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to see what songs/albums/artists I listen to the most
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to see what another user is currently listening to
- [x] As a user, I want to be able to find similar songs that I’ve been currently listening to
- [x] As a user, I want to be able to click on songs, and have them taken to the spotify page

## Standard Requirements:
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to add other users as friends
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to see how many times I listened to a song/album/artist over a given time frame
- [ ] As a user, I want to see my stats in an interesting, visual way
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to share my stats on Instagram easily

## Stretch goals:
- [ ] As a user, I want to see a comparison of how my music taste is similar to another user
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to have a weekly generated playlist of my favourite songs
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to express my mood and have a playlist created based on songs I’ve previously listened to, to curate a playlist for me
- [ ] Possible to create a playlist using ML gathering a bunch of info from different users?
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to recommend my top songs to my friends.

## Minimal Tasks:
- [x] Set up Node/express backend
- [ ] Stub out backend endpoints we will need
- [x] Set up OAuth Spotify login
- [x] Make a simple API call on behalf of the user
- [x] Create React App
- [x] Make a login page with a big login button
