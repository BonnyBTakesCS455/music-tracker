# music-tracker

## Description:
Our Spotify tracker web app allows music listeners to view their music tastes and stats, analyze their listening history and trends, and compare with their friends. It is similar to Spotify Wrapped but supports more timeframes, will track more metrics and give you more insights on your music listening.

## Some additional functionality: 
- [ ] Community sharing
- [ ] Genre specific music “share rooms”
- [ ] Extensions to shows, podcasts, etc.
- [ ] Allow artists to interact with listeners of their music
- [ ] Use machine learning to recommend users new music (very stretch!)

## Minimal Requirements:
- [x] As a user, I want to be able to see what songs/albums/artists I listen to the most
- [x] As a user, I want to be able to see what another user's favourite songs are
- [x] As a user, I want to see a comparison of how my music taste is similar to another user
- [x] As a user, I want to be able to click on songs, and have them taken to the spotify page

## Standard Requirements:
- [x] As a user, I want to be able to find similar songs that I’ve been currently listening to

- [x] As a user, I want to see song recommendations based off of the songs I recently listened to
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to see my top tracks and songs

## Stretch goals:
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to share my stats on Instagram easily
- [ ] As a user, I want to see a comparison of how my music taste is similar to another user
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to have a weekly generated playlist of my favourite songs
- [ ] Possible to create a playlist using ML gathering a bunch of info from different users?
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to recommend my top songs to my friends.
